Random Password Generator with Reactjs <br>
Introduction:<br>
We’ll walk through how to create a password generator app with React. The app will enable users to create strong passwords with various combinations of characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. It’ll also have an indicator to help gauge the strength of the user’s chosen password.<br>

Let's break down the code step by step and explain each concept used in the provided React application.<br>
Step 1: Importing  Dependencies<br>
In this step, the necessary dependencies are imported. React is imported to create React components, and useState and useEffect are hooks provided by React to manage state and side-effects respectively. The styles.css file contains the CSS styles for the application.<br>

Step 2: Functional Component Definition<br>
In this step, a functional React component named App is defined. The useState hook is used to create state variables for managing the password, password length, and options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in the generated password. The errors state variable is used to handle error messages.<br>

Step 3: Password Generation Logic<br>
The generatePassword function is responsible for generating the password based on user preferences. It checks the selected options and password length and generates a password accordingly. If there are errors in the user input, appropriate error messages are set using the setErrors function.<br>

Step 4: Randomization Functions<br>

These functions are helper functions used by the generatePassword function. random generates a random number within a specified range, randomLower and randomUpper generate random lowercase and uppercase letters respectively, and randomSymbol generates a random symbol from a predefined set of symbols.<br>

Step 5: useEffect Hook<br>
The useEffect hook is used to generate a password when the component is mounted. It runs the generatePassword function once, initializing the password based on the default preferences.<br>
